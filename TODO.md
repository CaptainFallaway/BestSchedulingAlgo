# TODO

- [ ] Add some functionality to style each pixel
- [x] Figure out what to do so we can remove the manual addition of offsets in the render function for the component
- [x] Move diagram_box and border out of the graphing dir
- [ ] Rename graphing dir to "terminal renderer"
- [ ] Refactor and change names - add comments also - Make project more documented
- [ ] make building the ui experience better
- [ ] Use Sync.Pool in places where it should be to help with the GC overhead
- [x] Add a delta for each render cycle that will be parsed to the "Render" functions
- [ ] Not a string builder ffs, do something with bytes, remove more overhead :D
